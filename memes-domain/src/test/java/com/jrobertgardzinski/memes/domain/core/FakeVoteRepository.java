/**
 * An in-memory {@link VoteRepository}: ballots in a map, keyed by meme and then by voter, so a
 * test can give a meme a score instead of asserting against a store that has none.
 *
 * <p>Public, and this module's own test-jar publishes it, for the reason {@link FakeMemeErasure}
 * is: a consumer that needs a score — the account-closure specs one repository up, where
 * {@code KEEP_POPULAR_ANONYMIZED} is decided — should not have to write its own, and MUST NOT
 * reach for a mock. A mocked {@code scoreOf} answers 0 for ever, which silently makes the only
 * rule that reads a score unstatable and hides the ordering {@code PurgeUserContent} depends on:
 * the leaver's own ballots are retracted BEFORE any score is read, and a mock cannot tell the
 * difference.
 *
 * <p>The score is the sum of the ballots and nothing else; there is no separate counter to fall
 * out of step with them, which is the one promise every caller here leans on.
