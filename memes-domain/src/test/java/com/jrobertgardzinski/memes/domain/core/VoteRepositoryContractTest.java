/**
 * What {@link VoteRepository} promises, asked of EVERY implementation — the JDBC adapter the
 * service runs on and each stand-in used in its place. A stand-in that drifts does not fail; it
 * makes a green suite say something about a service that does not exist, which is worse than a
 * mock, because it is convincingly wrong.
 *
 * <p>These are not arbitrary promises: they are what {@code PurgeUserContent} leans on when it
 * retracts the leaver's ballots and only then reads each meme's score, and what
 * {@code ShowMemeScores} and {@code RankMemes} lean on when they ask for a page of scores in one
 * go. {@code KEEP_POPULAR_ANONYMIZED} — the one {@code PurgeRule} that reads a score — had no
 * scenario anywhere in the portal while the specs ran on {@code mock(VoteRepository.class)}, whose
 * {@code scoreOf} answers 0 for ever; the stand-in is what made that rule statable, so the
 * stand-in's arithmetic is now load-bearing.
 *
 * <p>Fresh ids AND fresh voter names per test method, because one implementation is a database
 * other suites share: {@code purgeVoter} is keyed by the voter alone, across every meme in the
 * store, and {@link VoteRepository#allScores()} answers about the whole of it. Every assertion
 * below therefore speaks only about this run's own ids.
 *
 * <p><b>What this contract deliberately does NOT state</b>, so that the three known asymmetries
 * are named in one place instead of discovered:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Casting on a meme the world may not vote on.</b> The adapter's MERGE selects from
 *       {@code active_memes}, so a ballot on a deleted meme — or on one a running closure saga has
 *       reserved — quietly does not happen; the in-memory stand-in has no meme store to ask and
 *       records it. That guard is the schema's and the SQL's, and it is pinned where it lives, by
 *       {@code OrphanBallotTest} against a real database. The contract only requires that the
 *       implementation be TOLD which memes are votable, through {@link #givenVotableMeme}.</li>
 *   <li><b>The publication time in {@link VoteRepository#allScores()}.</b> The adapter reads it off
 *       the meme row; a stand-in over ballots alone has none and answers empty, which the ranking
 *       reads as "brand new". No stand-in is therefore fit to rank a gallery, and none is asked to
 *       — {@code RankMemes} is specified against the adapter.</li>
 *   <li><b>Whether an unvoted id is absent from {@link VoteRepository#scoresOf} or present with
 *       0.</b> The port says so in as many words, and leaves it to the use case, which is the only
 *       place that also knows what the meme store says. The contract asks for the one thing both
 *       answers agree on: nothing that is read as a score other than 0.</li>
 * </ul>
