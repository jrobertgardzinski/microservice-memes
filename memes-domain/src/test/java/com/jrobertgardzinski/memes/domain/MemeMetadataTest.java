/**
 * The two transitions the whole compensatable saga rests on, tested where they are DECIDED rather
 * than where they are stored. Everything above this record — the use cases, the adapters, the
 * orchestrator — can only be as correct as these four lines, and until this class existed the
 * rules were stated in prose (the javadoc, the ADR, a CHECK constraint) and asserted nowhere: the
 * use-case tests run on a fixed clock, so "a redelivery keeps the FIRST instant" was literally
 * unobservable there.
