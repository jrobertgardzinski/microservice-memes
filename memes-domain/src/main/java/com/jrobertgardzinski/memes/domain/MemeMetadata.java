/**
 * A {@link Meme} without its image: the identifier, who uploaded it, the format its bytes are
 * stored in, and — since the offboarding saga learnt to compensate — whether the row is part of the
 * gallery at all. This is what the questions ABOUT a meme need: "is there such a meme?", "who may
 * delete it?", "whose tags are these?", "is this waiting to be erased?" — and none of them needs
 * the picture.
 *
 * <p>The type exists because {@link Meme} made the bytes unavoidable: every authorisation check
 * dragged the full image out of object storage just to read one e-mail address off it, and a meme
 * whose bytes were missing from the active store answered "no such meme" to its own author. A row
 * and its picture are two different facts; this record is the first one alone.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is where the erasure state lives, and deliberately not on {@link Meme}.</strong>
 * Marking a leaver's memes is a bulk operation over rows — hundreds of them, in one transaction —
 * and every one of those rows carries a photograph in object storage. Putting the transition on the
 * bytes-carrying record would mean a blob read per meme to change one enum, which is the exact cost
 * this type was extracted to stop paying. Nothing is lost by it: the picture is only ever loaded
 * for something that is {@link MemeStatus#ACTIVE}, because every public read goes through a
 * repository that cannot see anything else.
 *
 * <p><strong>Transitions are methods, never a setter.</strong> {@link #markForErasure(Instant)} and
 * {@link #restore()} are the only two ways the status ever changes, they return a new value (this
 * is a record — the old state stays valid), and both are IDEMPOTENT: Kafka delivers at-least-once,
 * so each of them is going to be asked to do what it has already done. Marking twice keeps the
 * FIRST timestamp, because the mark's age is what the reaper's query and the stuck-erasure alarm
 * are measured against, and a redelivered command must not make an old obligation look fresh.
