/**
 * The IRREVERSIBLE half of an account deletion, and the reason the saga has a pivot. It runs on the
 * orchestrator's closure command — after every participant has confirmed its reversible mark, so
 * after the last moment at which anything could still go wrong for a reason this service would have
 * to undo. It acts on exactly the memes this service reserved
 * ({@link MemeErasure#pendingOf(String)}), never on "everything by that author": a meme uploaded
 * after the mark belongs to no saga and is not the closure's business.
 *
 * <p>The {@link PurgeRule} decides each reserved meme's fate by its score — delete it, or keep it
 * anonymised. Resolution order: the rule carried with the saga command, then the admin's runtime
 * {@link PurgePolicyOverride}, then the deployment default. A meme that goes takes its votes and
 * dedup-index entry along, and a {@code MEME_DELETED} event tells microservice-comments to drop the
 * thread. A meme that stays loses its author and comes BACK to the gallery — the mark was a
 * reservation, and a meme the rule keeps was never going to be erased. Votes the leaver cast are
 * always retracted. Idempotent — the saga may deliver the command twice, and the second delivery
 * finds nothing reserved.
 *
 * <p><strong>THE PIVOT lives inside this use case</strong>, at {@link MemeRepository#deleteById}:
 * that call takes the image out of object storage (MinIO/S3 in the deployed stack), and no message
 * from anywhere can bring it back. Everything before it — the mark, the invisibility, the whole
 * waiting — is undoable; everything from it on can only be RETRIED, which is why the obligation to
 * delete the bytes is itself durable (V9's {@code pending_blob_deletes}) rather than a promise held
 * in one JVM's memory. A saga that reaches this line has therefore already collected every
 * confirmation it will ever need.
 *
 * <p><strong>An absent rule is silence, not a choice.</strong> {@code requested} empty means the
 * command carried no policy at all, and this use case reads that as "decide for me" — which is why
 * the override gets its say next. It does NOT mean the leaver asked for the deployment default: a
 * wizard that wants its own label honoured has to say so, and the memes-ui wizard did not for its
 * preselected option (it sent an empty choice map, so the orchestrator omitted the policy field and
 * an admin's override silently replaced a stated "delete my memes" — P18 poz. 18). The order above
 * therefore honours the leaver over the operator only for a rule that actually arrived here.
