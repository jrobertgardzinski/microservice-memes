/**
 * Counts the obligations this service is sitting on — and does nothing about them on purpose.
 *
 * <p>A meme is marked {@code PENDING_ERASURE} by the saga's first, reversible step, and only the
 * orchestrator's closure turns that mark into a delete. A mark standing longer than any saga can
 * legitimately last therefore means the closure never arrived. The content is invisible, which is
 * what the leaver asked for, but it is still on disk, which is not what the law asked for — and
 * nobody would find out, because the failure is silent by construction: nothing throws, a query
 * simply returns fewer rows for ever.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this does not erase them.</strong> Deleting on the passage of time means guessing
 * what the orchestrator decided, and the guess is wrong exactly when it is expensive: a saga stuck
 * for an hour because a sibling is down may still COMPENSATE, and content erased on a timer cannot
 * come back. The saga's state is knowable; this service is just not the one that knows it. So the
 * backlog is stated, and an operator acts on it (re-drive the closure, or compensate).
 *
 * <p>It states the fact on EVERY pass, zero included — the question is "how many right now", so
 * saying nothing would leave yesterday's answer standing as if it were today's.
