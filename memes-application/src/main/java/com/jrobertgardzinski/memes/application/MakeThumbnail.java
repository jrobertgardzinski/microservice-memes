/**
 * Makes a thumbnail (small PNG) of a stored meme on demand. Empty if there is no such meme.
 *
 * <p>Cached in the {@link ObjectStore} under {@code {id}.thumb}, the same pattern as ServeMeme's
 * WebP variant: the FIRST request decodes the full image (under the infrastructure's decode
 * semaphore — the expensive, permit-holding step) and caches the result; every later request is
 * served straight from the store — no decode, no permit, just one indexed existence check on the
 * meme row. Before this, EVERY thumbnail request decoded the full image, so a burst of gallery
 * scrolls could saturate the semaphore and feed readers 429s. A thumbnail is immutable per id
 * (ids never return to circulation), so the cache needs no invalidation beyond the delete sweep
 * in the repository adapter — but it does need that existence check, because a crash can strand
 * a variant no sweep will ever reach (see {@link #execute}).

        // put and the re-check leaves a .thumb of a meme that is gone, no later delete will
        // ever come for it, and a cache-only hit would keep serving a deleted person's picture
        // forever. (ServeMeme's .webp variant cannot be SERVED that way either — it now asks the
        // same exists() gate before touching the store — but it is not swept: no request for a
        // deleted meme's WebP goes past that gate, so nothing there notices the orphan.)
        //
        // The gate is exists(), not find(): one indexed "SELECT 1 FROM memes WHERE id = ?" that
        // loads no blob. Measured on the DB store (H2, warm): ~21us for the exists, ~12us for the
        // blob read it joins, ~609us for the whole served cache hit — the gate costs about 3.5%
        // of a hit it makes safe. At that price tightness beats statistics: a sampled check
        // (every Nth hit) would keep serving the orphan in between, and a periodic sweep would
        // have to enumerate the store to find one. Ids are never reissued, so a hit that passes
        // this gate can never be a DIFFERENT meme's thumbnail.
        //

        // first, an orphan (and every request for an id that is simply gone) paid a full blob
        // read from S3/MinIO for bytes that were then thrown away. The cheap, local question
        // decides first; the expensive, remote one is asked only for a meme that is really there.

     *
     * <p>BEST-EFFORT, like every other write to the {@link ObjectStore} on a read path (see
     * {@link #cacheBestEffort}). In production the store is S3/MinIO and its delete can throw
     * {@code SdkException} — an unchecked exception that used to ride straight out of the use
     * case, through the controller, and answer a MinIO hiccup with a 500. The honest answer to
     * "give me the thumbnail of a meme that does not exist" is 404, whether or not the cleanup
     * behind it succeeded; a surviving orphan is a wasted object, not a wrong answer, and the
     * next request will try to sweep it again.
     *
     * <p>The delete is unconditional because the store has no cheap "is there anything there?" —
     * asking would mean the full blob read this order exists to avoid. A delete of a key that is
     * not there is a no-op in both adapters (a DELETE ... WHERE key = ? that matches no row, a
     * 204 from S3), so the cost of the blind sweep is one round trip on a 404, and it buys the
     * orphan case a sweep that costs no blob transfer at all. That trade is also why this logs at
     * DEBUG: after the reorder a sweep can no longer tell an orphan apart from a request for an
     * id that never existed, so the line stopped being evidence of a crash and would otherwise
     * shout on every 404.
