/**
 * The vote scores of a NAMED set of memes — the read a wall of tiles needs: one round trip for the
 * whole page, instead of one per thumbnail.
 *
 * <p>The distinction this use case exists to preserve is ZERO versus UNKNOWN. A meme this service
 * still has is answered with its score, and a meme nobody voted on scores 0 — that is a fact worth
 * printing. A meme this service does not have is simply ABSENT from the answer: no key, no number,
 * nothing to render. A client can then say "▲ 0" in the first case and "no tally" in the second,
 * which it can only do if the answer keeps the two apart.
 *
 * <p>Why that is worth a use case of its own: the wall used to read its numbers out of
 * {@link RankMemes}, whose page is a RANKING capped at {@link RankMemes#TOP_N}. Every meme past the
 * cap was missing from that list, and a client looking its id up found nothing — which it rendered
 * as a confident zero. "0 votes" under a meme that has votes is not a smaller lie for being an
 * accident, and it was waiting for the gallery to outgrow the cap to become visible.
