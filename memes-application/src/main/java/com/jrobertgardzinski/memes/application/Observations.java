/**
 * Where this service's {@link Observation}s go. The one port between "the code has noticed
 * something" and whatever is watching this month.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately the narrowest interface that can carry every fact: a caller states WHAT happened
 * and nothing about how it should be counted, named, labelled or alerted on. Those are the watching
 * tool's decisions, and they are exactly what changes when the tool does.
 *
 * <p>Removing the adapter must leave this service working — an unobserved service is a service
 * nobody is watching, not a broken one — so the composition root binds a do-nothing implementation
 * rather than leaving the port empty.
