# The gallery's browser entry point, end to end — and END TO END means it: the scenarios run
# against the REAL portal stack (docker compose), where security keeps its state in Postgres,
# mails travel the outbox -> Kafka -> microservice-email -> SMTP road into Mailpit, the
# account-deletion saga is carried by offboarding, and memes/comments/collections purge their
# content and confirm it for real.
#
# It used to boot four jars with in-memory stores and no broker. That made the identity half
# quick to test and the saga half impossible — security's `test` environment has no outbox
# publisher at all (@Requires(notEnv = "test")), so nothing ever reached a broker and a deleted
# account merely locked. An end-to-end missing a member proves nothing about the member it
# skipped (the owner, 2026-07-20: „chujowo robić e2e bez jakiegoś członu").
#
# The stack is started here when it is not already up; KEEP_STACK=1 leaves it running afterwards
# (the fast loop while writing scenarios), otherwise this takes it back down.
