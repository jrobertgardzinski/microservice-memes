/**
 * What the wizard says when the step-up did not succeed — and whether it lets the person try again.
 *
 * Every non-2xx used to read "Wrong password.", so a throttled attempt or a 500 accused the person
 * of mistyping a password that was right; and a request that never arrived threw straight past
 * `setBusy(false)`, leaving every button disabled with no message at all — the only way out was
 * reloading the page (P18 poz. 40). The 429 case is not hypothetical any more: step-up gained a
 * rate limit in P18 poz. 5, so "wait a moment" is now a routine answer that must not be dressed
 * up as a wrong password.
