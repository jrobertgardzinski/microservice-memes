/**
 * Which of the two upload filters decides first — asserted, because it was documented wrongly and
 * a reader acted on the documentation.
 *
 * <p>{@link RejectOversizedUploadFilterTest}'s javadoc used to say that {@link RequireSignInFilter}
 * runs first, so an anonymous oversized POST is refused 401, and it left the anonymous case
 * untested for exactly that reason. The chain says otherwise: the size filter carries
 * {@code @Order(HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 10)} and the sign-in gate carries no {@code @Order} at all,
 * which puts it at LOWEST_PRECEDENCE. An anonymous caller declaring twenty megabytes gets 413.
 *
 * <p>That IS the order this service wants, and it is a decision rather than an accident: the size
 * refusal is one integer comparison against a declared Content-Length, while the sign-in gate
 * introspects a token over HTTP against another service. Cheap refusal first means a flood of
 * oversized anonymous posts costs this service nothing and microservice-security nothing. Getting
 * it the other way round — by someone "restoring" the order the old comment described — would turn
 * the same flood into an introspection storm on the identity service every product shares.
 *
 * <p>Compared with the very comparator Spring registers servlet filters by, so this pins the
 * effective order rather than a restatement of the annotations.
