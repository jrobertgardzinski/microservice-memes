/**
 * The refusal an upload gets for ANNOUNCING more than this service accepts.
 *
 * <p>The filter shipped on 2026-07-28 with no test at all, and with a rationale that turned out to
 * be wrong: it was said to turn an "internal error" into a truthful 413, when Spring answers 413 for
 * an oversized multipart on its own. What it really buys is that the refusal happens on the
 * DECLARED length, before the multipart is spooled to the container's disk — which is what these
 * tests pin.
 *
 * <p>Driven directly rather than through the application, because that is what it is — a servlet
 * filter with one decision.
 *
 * <p><strong>Which filter runs first, corrected.</strong> This javadoc used to state that
 * {@link RequireSignInFilter} runs BEFORE this one, so that an anonymous oversized upload is
 * refused 401 — and it explained the absence of a test for the anonymous caller with exactly that.
 * The chain says the opposite: this filter is {@code @Order(HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 10)} and
 * RequireSignInFilter carries no {@code @Order} at all, which registers it at LOWEST_PRECEDENCE.
 * An anonymous POST declaring twenty megabytes therefore gets 413, never 401.
 *
 * <p>That order is the right one and is now pinned rather than assumed
 * ({@link FilterOrderTest}): refusing on a declared length costs one integer comparison, while
 * authenticating costs a token introspection over HTTP to another service, and doing the cheap
 * refusal first is what keeps a flood of oversized anonymous posts from becoming a flood of
 * introspection calls. Nothing is leaked by it — 413 to an anonymous caller says only that the
 * request was too big, which it was.
