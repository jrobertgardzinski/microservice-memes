/**
 * WHERE the saga's confirmation goes — the half of the contract the committed pact cannot see.
 *
 * <p>The audit of 26.07 spelled the gap out: the provider pact answers with
 * {@code confirmation.payload()}, so it pins the SHAPE and throws the topic away. A confirmation with
 * a perfect shape published on {@code meme-events}, {@code memes-events-v2} or the cascade's own topic
 * would satisfy every pact, every unit test and every green dashboard, while microservice-offboarding
 * waited 120 seconds, re-commanded three times, capitulated, and handed each leaver back an account
 * whose content this service had already erased. Same species as {@link MemeDeletedTopicTest}, same
 * remedy: a literal, asserted against the record the REAL path to the broker produces.
 *
 * <p>The twin literal lives in <b>microservice-offboarding</b>, in the participants map
 * {@code Main.DEFAULT_PARTICIPANTS} ({@code memes=memes-events}) and in the deployment's
 * {@code OFFBOARDING_PARTICIPANTS}. Changing the string here REQUIRES changing it there.
