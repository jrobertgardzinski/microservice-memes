/**
 * A configuration pin, the same species as {@link KafkaProducerClocksTest}: it asserts that a
 * property the CODE'S PROMISES depend on actually reaches the component that honours it — here, the
 * consumer's starting position for a group with no committed offset.
 *
 * <p>What depends on it: Kafka's own default is {@code latest}, and {@code latest} loses records
 * without a trace. A consumer group that has not committed an offset yet — a fresh environment, or
 * Kafka switched on after this service ran without it — starts AFTER whatever
 * {@code content-commands} already holds, so purge commands published before the group's first poll
 * are never seen: no log line, no metric, a saga that times out and compensates for no visible
 * reason. {@code earliest} walks the retained history instead, and the purge being idempotent
 * ({@code PurgeCommandsListener}'s own contract), repeating it costs nothing — the reasoning
 * microservice-user-collections wrote down next to the very same setting.
 *
 * <p>The scenario cannot be staged here without a broker and two deployments, so this pins the
 * configuration instead: drop or misspell the property and this fails, instead of the first k3s
 * environment quietly skipping the deletions that were commanded before the group existed.
