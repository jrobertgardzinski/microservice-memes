/**
 * The two URLs Kubernetes actually calls — asserted over HTTP, which nothing did until now.
 *
 * <p>{@link ListenerHealthProbeGroupsTest} pins WHICH group the listener lamp belongs to and proves
 * the property names really build those groups. What neither it nor anything else touched is the
 * ADDRESS. {@code portal/k8s/base/memes.yaml} names {@code /actuator/health/readiness} and
 * {@code /actuator/health/liveness}, and a perfectly configured group can sit behind a path that
 * answers 404 — the path depends on {@code management.endpoints.web.exposure.include}, on the
 * actuator base path, and on the framework still serving groups as path segments at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why now.</strong> Spring Boot 4 moved the health API to a new package and split the
 * actuator into modules on 2026-07-29. The group configuration came through untouched and the older
 * test proved that; the URL was assumed on both sides of the migration. With k3s next, an assumed
 * probe URL is the sort of thing discovered by a pod that never goes ready.
 *
 * <p><strong>On the management port.</strong> Production serves these on 9083
 * ({@code management.server.port}), the main API on 8083 — this test drops that separation, because
 * MockMvc has no ports at all. So what is proven here is the PATH and the group's contents, not the
 * port split.
 *
 * <p>This paragraph used to add "portal/wait-healthy.sh and the compose healthcheck cover the port",
 * and that was false in the direction that matters: the compose healthcheck hardcodes 9083 and only
 * runs when somebody stands the stack up, so nothing at all compared the number this file ships with
 * the {@code containerPort} the k8s manifest probes. Two numbers in two files, and if they drift
 * NOTHING notices — every suite green, every gate green, and a pod that never becomes Ready. That is
 * not hypothetical here: Prometheus scraped memes on 8083 for a whole day after the actuator moved
 * to 9083, with no symptom but empty dashboards. comments grew a guard against exactly this on
 * 2026-07-29; {@link #the_manifest_probes_the_port_the_actuator_listens_on} is the same guard for
 * the service the story started in.
 *
 * <p>Asserts the group's own component rather than only the status code: a 200 carrying a
 * differently shaped body would still fail the probe's purpose.
 *
 * <p><strong>Exactly one property is set here, and it is not one of the ones under test.</strong>
 * This class used to hand itself the whole management block — the two group definitions AND
 * {@code exposure.include=health,prometheus} — duplicating
 * {@code src/main/resources/application.properties} instead of reading it. Annotation properties win
 * over the file, so the test proved its own five lines: drop {@code health} from the exposure line
 * that goes into the image and every assertion below still passed, while both probe URLs answered
 * 404 in the cluster and the pod never went Ready. (The commit that "verified these tests can fail"
 * verified a deletion from the test's list, not from the file's.) There is no
 * {@code application.properties} on this module's test classpath, so with the overrides gone the
 * context boots on the SHIPPED configuration and these three tests exercise it.
 *
 * <p>The survivor collapses {@code management.server.port} back onto the main one, because MockMvc
 * has no ports — that is the one thing this test genuinely cannot exercise, and it says so above.
