/**
 * Where MEME_DELETED goes — the first link of the deletion cascade, and the one the audit of 26.07
 * found nothing was guarding.
 *
 * <p>Its finding, in full: no assertion anywhere named a TOPIC. Rename it on one side only — a typo,
 * a copied constant, a "-v2" suffix — and this service publishes into the void while two other
 * services wait forever. No comment thread is dropped, no saved reference is cleaned up, nothing
 * throws, and every signal the portal has stays green (a green suite, {@code docker compose ps},
 * {@code up=1} in Prometheus), because every process involved is perfectly healthy. The blast radius
 * is a portal that keeps showing deleted memes' comments and collections' entries; the diagnosis
 * starts from a user complaint, not from CI.
 *
 * <p>So the name is pinned to a LITERAL here, against the record the REAL producer builds, and to
 * the same literal in each consuming repository. They cannot share a constant — separate git
 * repositories, released and versioned apart, and a shared library for one string would couple their
 * release cycles for nothing — so the literal is duplicated deliberately and this comment says where
 * its twins are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>microservice-comments</b> — {@code MemesEventsListener}'s {@code @KafkaListener(topics =
 *       "memes-events")}, pinned in
 *       {@code src/test/java/com/jrobertgardzinski/comments/infrastructure/CascadeTopicNamesTest.java}
 *       (it drops the dead meme's thread);</li>
 *   <li><b>microservice-user-collections</b> — {@code CascadeConsumer#MEMES_TOPIC}, pinned in
 *       {@code src/test/java/com/jrobertgardzinski/collections/infrastructure/CascadeTopicNamesTest.java}
 *       (it drops every saved reference to the meme).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Changing the string here REQUIRES the matching change in BOTH repositories, in the files
 * named above.</b> That is the price of separate repositories, and a test failing on every side is
 * what makes the price visible instead of silent.
 *
 * <p>The name is also checked ACROSS the repositories rather than only inside each: the MEME_DELETED
 * pact recorded by microservice-user-collections carries the topic as message metadata, and
 * {@link MemeDeletedPactProviderTest} answers it with the real record's {@code topic()}.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the record here comes from that class's fixture: the pact and this test must
 * assert the SAME real object, or one of them could go on passing while the other describes a
 * producer that no longer exists. Unlike the pact test this one has no {@code @EnabledIf} — it needs
 * no neighbouring checkout, so it runs in every layout, including a solo one.
