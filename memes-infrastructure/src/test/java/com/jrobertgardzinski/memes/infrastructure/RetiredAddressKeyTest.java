/**
 * The build-time guard on the retired key: <strong>the author id is the key of a row, the e-mail
 * address is not.</strong> The cutover moved every read, every ownership check and the whole
 * closure onto the id; what it cannot do is stop the next honestly-written SELECT from matching
 * memes by address again. A query like that looks harmless and quietly brings back the four
 * defects the id was adopted to end: a member who renames becomes a stranger to their own content,
 * their closure marks nothing while confirming an erasure, and whoever registers the freed address
 * next inherits what was left under it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this shape and not an ArchUnit rule.</strong> The same reason
 * {@code MemeReadFilterTest} gives: the rule is about the text of a SQL string, and a
 * bytecode-level rule cannot see inside a string constant. So it is enforced over the literals.
 *
 * <p>Only STRING LITERALS are scanned for the predicate, never prose — this javadoc names the
 * forbidden column several times, and a guard that a comment can trip is a guard that gets deleted.
 * The retired-machinery rule below is the opposite: it reads the whole file, identifiers included,
 * because {@code Rekey} and {@code EMAIL_CHANGED} must not come back as a class or a topic name
 * either.
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately NOT forbidden, each for a recorded reason:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code UPDATE memes SET author = ?, author_id = NULL WHERE id = ?} — a WRITE naming the
 *       address column. The address stays as an attribute (the placeholder "deleted account" is
 *       written into it), and a write is keyed by the row's own id, so it cannot match the wrong
 *       member.</li>
 *   <li>{@code voter} on {@code meme_votes} holds the voter's id in its wire form (the 1e
 *       decision: the Ballots API was left untouched), and {@code settings.updated_by} is an
 *       audit snapshot of who changed a setting, not a key anything is read by.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The last test is the counterweight: the scan MUST have seen SQL at all, so the rules above
 * cannot pass in a world where the queries moved somewhere this test does not look.
