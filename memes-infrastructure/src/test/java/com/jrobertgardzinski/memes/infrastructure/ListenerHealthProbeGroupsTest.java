/**
 * WHICH probe the listener lamp hangs on — a configuration pin, the same species as
 * {@link KafkaProducerClocksTest}: the decision lives in {@code application.properties}, where no code
 * can be wrong about it and nothing else would notice if it changed.
 *
 * <p>The decision: readiness, never liveness. A stopped Kafka listener cannot do this service's share
 * of an account deletion, so it must stop being handed work — but it is NOT a dead process (HTTP keeps
 * serving the gallery) and a restart would fix neither the broker nor the database that stopped it. A
 * liveness probe wired to it would crash-loop the pod through every dependency outage, which is
 * precisely the reasoning microservice-offboarding and microservice-user-collections wrote down when
 * they split {@code /alive} from {@code /health}. Getting these two lines the wrong way round is a
 * one-word mistake with a self-inflicted outage attached, and this test is what fails instead.
 *
 * <p>It also pins that the groups EXIST outside Kubernetes at all: Spring only auto-enables the
 * liveness/readiness probes when it detects a k8s (or Cloud Foundry) environment, and the portal's
 * actual home is a compose stack, where the groups would otherwise answer 404.
