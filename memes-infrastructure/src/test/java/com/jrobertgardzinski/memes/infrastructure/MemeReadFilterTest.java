/**
 * The build-time guard on the account-deletion filter: <strong>no read in this service may name the
 * {@code memes} table.</strong> Reads go through the {@code active_memes} view (V10), which is
 * where {@code WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'} is written down once, and a query that skips it is how a
 * leaver's content — hidden from the gallery, hidden from {@code /meta}, hidden from the ranking —
 * would come back out through some later, honestly-written SELECT.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this shape and not an ArchUnit rule.</strong> ArchUnit reasons about TYPES: who
 * may call whom, which package may depend on which. The rule that matters here is not about types
 * at all — every read already goes through one adapter and one port — it is about the text of a SQL
 * string, and a bytecode-level rule cannot see inside a string constant. So the rule is enforced
 * where it lives: over the SQL literals themselves. (The workspace has no ArchUnit dependency, and
 * adding one to express a rule it cannot express would buy a green test and no guarantee.)
 *
 * <p>Only STRING LITERALS are scanned, never prose: this class's own javadoc says "the memes table"
 * several times, and a guard that a comment can trip is a guard that gets deleted.
 *
 * <p>The exemption list is the point of the design and is deliberately one entry long. The last
 * assertion is its counterweight: the exempt adapter MUST still contain such a query, so the rule
 * cannot be satisfied by quietly deleting the erasure feature.
