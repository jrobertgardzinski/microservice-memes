/**
 * The axis of abuse nobody was watching: how many uploads may hold RAW BYTES at once.
 *
 * <p>{@code file.getBytes()} spends up to the multipart ceiling of heap per request, and the only
 * thing that used to bound the number of requests standing at that line was Tomcat's default of 200
 * threads — 2000 MB against a ~1075 MiB heap. The per-user rate limit is no help: it counts
 * requests over a window, so a single account can have its whole allowance in flight in the same
 * instant. Nor could the decode semaphore be taken earlier, because thumbnails take it too and one
 * thread would hold it twice.
