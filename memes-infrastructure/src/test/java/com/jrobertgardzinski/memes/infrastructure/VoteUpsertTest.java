/**
 * Two people cannot vote for each other, but ONE person can double-click — and the gallery's vote
 * arrows are not disabled while a request is in flight, so two first-time casts by the same voter
 * on the same meme really do arrive at once. The primary key {@code (meme_id, voter)} makes exactly
 * one of them a row; what this test is about is what the OTHER one gets back.
 *
 * <p>It used to get a 500. The cast was a DELETE followed by an INSERT: the loser's DELETE could
 * not see the winner's uncommitted row, deleted nothing, and its INSERT then landed on the key the
 * winner had already taken — {@code DuplicateKeyException}, handled nowhere, so an unhandled
 * exception for a double-click, with the second click's intended toggle lost on top.
 *
 * <p>The two interleavings are pinned separately because they fail differently: the DELETE that
 * misses the winner's row (simulated by a cast whose {@code retract} does nothing — which is what a
 * DELETE against an invisible row IS), and the MERGE that loses the {@code WHEN NOT MATCHED} race
 * on Postgres, where the answer is one retry down {@code WHEN MATCHED}. Neither can be produced on
 * cue by two real threads against H2, and a test that waits for a race to happen is a test that
 * passes for the wrong reason.
