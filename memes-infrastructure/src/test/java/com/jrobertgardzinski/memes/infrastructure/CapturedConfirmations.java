/**
 * The confirmation channel with the outbox taken out, and NOTHING else faked: it builds the event
 * exactly as production does — {@link PurgeConfirmations#confirmationOf} — and keeps it instead of
 * writing a row.
 *
 * <p>That distinction is the whole point for the pact test. The contract is about the PAYLOAD the
 * orchestrator parses, so the payload must come from the real builder driven by the real listener; a
 * hand-written JSON string in a test would verify the test's own idea of the envelope. What the pact
 * has no opinion about is where the bytes are stored on the way out, which is the only thing missing
 * here (and is covered by {@code PurgeConfirmationOutboxTest} against the real table).
