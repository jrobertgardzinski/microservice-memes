/**
 * A configuration pin, the same species as TransactionAwareDeletesTest's Hikari autocommit one:
 * it asserts that a property the CODE'S PROMISES depend on actually reaches the component that
 * honours it — here, the producer's blocking clocks.
 *
 * <p>What depends on them: {@link KafkaMemeEvents#publishFirstAttempt} claims the announcing
 * thread never waits for the broker. {@code KafkaTemplate.send()} is asynchronous only once the
 * record is in the accumulator; reaching it blocks the CALLING thread on the metadata fetch
 * (a leaderless topic has none) and on buffer space for up to {@code max.block.ms}. Kafka's own
 * default is 60s, so a purge of N memes — announced from the Kafka LISTENER thread after a
 * single commit — would hold that thread N&times;60s against a leaderless {@code memes-events}:
 * WORSE than the N&times;5s {@code Future.get()} the outbox replaced, and the very
 * {@code max.poll.interval.ms} overrun (300s) that the outbox was built to avoid.
 *
 * <p>A broker outage cannot be staged with a mock KafkaTemplate — the blocking lives inside the
 * real producer — so this pins the configuration instead: change or drop the properties and this
 * fails, instead of the javadoc quietly becoming a lie.
 *
 * <p>CAVEAT, the same one the Hikari pin carries: these are env-overridable at DEPLOY time
 * (MEMES_KAFKA_MAX_BLOCK_MS and friends), where no test runs.
