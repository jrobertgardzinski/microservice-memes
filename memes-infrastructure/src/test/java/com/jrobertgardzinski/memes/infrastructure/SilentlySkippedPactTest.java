/**
 * The guard on the guards: a contract test that never runs is indistinguishable from one that
 * passes, and it took a workspace split for the portal to learn that the hard way —
 * {@code SecurityOutcomePactProviderTest} in microservice-offboarding looked for its pact among the
 * portal siblings, where it had not been for weeks, and quietly skipped on every single run. Its
 * green tick meant "the file was not there", which is the exact opposite of what a reader assumes a
 * green contract test means.
 *
 * <p>Both provider pact tests in this repo therefore keep the workspace's skip-not-fail convention
 * (a solo checkout of one service must still build) and this class draws the line the convention
 * needs: <b>skipping is allowed only when the neighbouring repository is genuinely absent.</b> If the
 * neighbour IS checked out and the pact the provider test loads is not where that test looks, the
 * silence is a stale path, not a lone checkout — and it fails here instead of hiding.
 *
 * <p>This class carries no {@code @EnabledIf} of its own on purpose: it must run in every layout, so
 * that the one thing it can prove — "nothing here is being skipped for the wrong reason" — is proven
 * on every run.
