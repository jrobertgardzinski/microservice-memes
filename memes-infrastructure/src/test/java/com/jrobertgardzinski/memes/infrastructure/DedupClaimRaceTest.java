/**
 * The dedup claim's promise — "two simultaneous uploads of the same picture race the constraint and
 * exactly one insert wins; the loser reads the winner back" — against the REAL adapter and a real
 * schema.
 *
 * <p>The race's pin used to live one layer up, on a {@code putIfAbsent} fake, so it could not see
 * the only place the promise can break: the SQL. And it did break — the winner claims first and
 * saves afterwards, in a separate transaction, so there is a window in which the claim is committed
 * and the meme row is not. A read of the holder through {@code active_memes} finds nothing in that
 * window and cannot tell it from a meme a deletion saga has reserved.
 *
 * <p>No threads here on purpose: the window is a STATE, not an instant, and it is reproduced by
 * claiming without saving — which is exactly what the winner's thread has done when the loser
 * arrives. A test that waits for a race to happen is a test that passes for the wrong reason.
