/**
 * A law, in the spirit of ADR 0006: memes and comments are TWINS, and where the twins must agree,
 * the build says so instead of a person noticing.
 *
 * <p>The two services are built the same way on purpose — same framework, same outbox, same
 * consumer, same probes. That similarity is what makes a difference between them so hard to see:
 * every earlier drift was found by reading the two files side by side and remembering what the other
 * one said, which works right up until it does not. P13 found the retention setting on one and not
 * the other; P18 found the stall threshold on one and not the other. Same shape, twice.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of agreement, and the difference matters:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #SAME_VALUE} — the setting means the same thing in both and the VALUE must match
 *       exactly. A log pattern that prints the correlation id in one service and not the other makes
 *       a saga untraceable at exactly the moment somebody is tracing it.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SAME_DEFAULT} — each service reads its own environment variable, so the keys and the
 *       variable names differ by design; what must match is the DEFAULT, because that is what runs
 *       when nobody sets anything, which is most of the time.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately NOT compared: ports, database URLs, service URLs, rate limits and the
 * purge policy. Those differ because the services differ — memes deletes what it holds, comments
 * anonymises it, and that was a decision, not a drift.
