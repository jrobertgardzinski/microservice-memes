/**
 * The budget's arithmetic, on a steered clock — because the numbers ARE the decision here.
 *
 * <p>Two failure modes have to be told apart, and a count of attempts cannot tell them apart: a store
 * that refuses instantly (a rolled-back transaction) and a store that refuses after blocking (Postgres
 * gone, one Hikari {@code connection-timeout} per attempt). Ten attempts mean 90 seconds in the first
 * case and five minutes in the second — which is why the budget is measured on the wall clock, and why
 * this test drives the clock rather than the count.
