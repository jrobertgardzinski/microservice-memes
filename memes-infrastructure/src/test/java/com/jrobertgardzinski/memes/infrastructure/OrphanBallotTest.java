/**
 * A ballot must not outlive the meme it votes on (P18 poz. 28).
 *
 * <p>Why it matters more than tidiness: the hot page joins ballots to memes on the LEFT and treats a
 * meme with no known publication time as brand new rather than burying it (RankMemes.hotness) —
 * which is the biggest multiplier the ranking has. An orphan ballot therefore does not sit quietly
 * in a table; it puts a meme that cannot be served at the top of the page and keeps it there. After
 * a GDPR purge it is also a leftover of a deleted account's activity.
 *
 * <p>The window is real: {@code CastVote} checks {@code exists(memeId)} and inserts the ballot in a
 * SEPARATE transaction, so a delete committing in between used to produce exactly that row, and
 * nothing looked for it afterwards ({@code purgeMeme} had already run for that meme).
