/**
 * The one thing the lamp's unit test cannot check: that the running loop's heartbeat actually REACHES
 * it. This test boots the real application with listeners enabled and waits for a real
 * {@code ListenerContainerIdleEvent} to move the real marker.
 *
 * <p>It exists because that wiring was wrong and everything else stayed green. A
 * {@code @KafkaListener} is registered as a {@code ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer} under the id
 * given in the annotation, but the thread that polls belongs to its CHILD container, whose bean name
 * carries a {@code -0} suffix — and the child is what publishes the idle events. Looking the marker up
 * by the registered id alone found nothing, ever, so the lamp fell back to its boot grace and turned
 * every healthy instance red exactly {@code stall-tolerance} seconds after start. Unit tests passed
 * (they publish the event with the id they then query), the suite passed, the stack came up green —
 * and the readiness probe of a perfectly healthy service went 503 two and a half minutes later, on a
 * live stack. That is the audit's own theme, scored against this very package: a signal that proves
 * a process exists proves nothing about the function.
 *
 * <p>No broker is needed and none is started: a consumer polling a bootstrap address with nothing
 * behind it gets empty results, which is exactly the situation the heartbeat is FOR — an idle topic
 * must read as alive. The idle interval is shortened to a second so the wait is a second, not ten.
