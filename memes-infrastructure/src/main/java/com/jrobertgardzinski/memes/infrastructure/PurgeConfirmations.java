/**
 * The saga's other half, from this service's side: USER_CONTENT_PURGED, the confirmation
 * microservice-offboarding waits for before it lets microservice-security delete the account.
 *
 * <p><strong>What changed and why it matters.</strong> The confirmation used to be a bare
 * {@code kafka.send(...)}: no wait, no callback, not even a log line of its own. Spring Kafka commits
 * the command's offset as soon as the listener returns, so the sequence "content deleted, offset
 * committed, confirmation lost in the producer's accumulator" was reachable — and its consequence is
 * the worst outcome this system has: the memes are gone, the orchestrator never hears it, after three
 * re-commands it compensates, and the leaver gets their account back WITHOUT their content, together
 * with a mail apologising that the deletion failed. Meanwhile this very service already owned a
 * transactional outbox, on this very topic, for MEME_DELETED.
 *
 * <p>So the confirmation now rides that outbox, and it is written in the SAME transaction as the
 * purge (opened by {@link PurgeCommandsListener}, joined by the use case's transactional decorator).
 * That single change buys both directions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>nothing is purged without a durable obligation to confirm it — if the row cannot be written,
 *       the erasure rolls back with it and the command is retried;</li>
 *   <li>no confirmation escapes a purge that rolled back — the first send is parked on the commit by
 *       the library.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A crash or a broker outage between the commit and the send loses nothing either: the row stays
 * unpublished and the republisher re-sends it, marking it only once the broker has acknowledged.
 *
 * <p><strong>PII, deliberately weighed.</strong> The row carries the leaver's address, because the
 * orchestrator matches confirmations on it (its committed pact says so) — this cannot be a
 * pseudonymised event. It is the one place in this service where an erased address lingers, for at
 * most the outbox retention (24h, {@code MEMES_OUTBOX_RETENTION_HOURS}), which is well inside the 30
 * days the orchestrator's own saga table keeps the same address. The logs, which have no retention
 * anyone controls, still never see it.
 *
 * @see KafkaMemeEvents the cascade's announcement on the same topic, same outbox, same discipline

     * {@code email}, {@code version} 1 (workspace ADR 0004 — fields are only ever added within a
     * version), and the orchestrator's committed pact pins exactly these. In particular the event id
     * is NOT pasted into the payload, unlike MEME_DELETED: a consumer needs the id to recognise a
     * redelivered duplicate, and for confirmations there is nothing to recognise — recording a
     * participant's confirmation against a saga is idempotent by construction (a set), and a
     * confirmation for a saga that has closed is dropped as stray. Adding a field to a pinned
     * envelope to solve a problem nobody has is churn, not compatibility.
     *
     * <p>Built with Jackson rather than string concatenation, which the sibling announcement can
     * afford: the values here come off the wire (an address, a saga id from a JSON field), and an
     * address may legally contain a quote — {@code "odd\"one"@example.com}. Concatenating that would
     * produce a payload the broker accepts and no consumer can parse.
     *
     * <p>Package-private and free of the outbox so the contract tests can build the real payload
     * without a database — the shape is what they verify, and a table is not part of the shape.

     * <p>The outbox's {@code event_key} column is {@code varchar(64)} and an address may be 254
     * characters (RFC 5321). A long address would fail the INSERT inside the purge's transaction —
     * rolling back the erasure, retry after retry, until the budget dropped the command. The saga id

     *
     * <p>A key is not a payload: it shows up in broker tooling, in consumer-lag dashboards and in
     * every dump of the topic, so keeping an address out of it is free hygiene on the one topic whose
     * traffic is about erasing that address.
     *
     * <p>Nothing depends on the old key. The orchestrator's router reads every partition and a
     * confirmation is idempotent; the only property a key must have here is that every redelivery of
     * this row carries the same one, which a stored key does by construction.
     *
     * <p>A command with no {@code sagaId} (the orchestrator always sends one — absence is tolerated
     * only for older producers) falls back to an id DERIVED from the address, the same
     * {@code nameUUIDFromBytes} idiom the orchestrator uses for its own re-published outcomes: never
     * blank, because the outbox refuses a blank key, and never the address itself.
