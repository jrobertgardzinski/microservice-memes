     * out). V8's foreign key is what GUARANTEES no orphan can exist; an empty source here decides
     * what the loser of that race sees — a vote that quietly did not happen on a meme that is gone,
     * rather than a 500 from a constraint violation. active_memes, not memes: a meme a running
     * account-deletion saga has reserved is not something the world may vote on either — and the
     * ballot would then have to be restored (or not) by the compensation, which is a decision
     * nobody should have to make.
