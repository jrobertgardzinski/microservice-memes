/**
 * What this service does about somebody changing their e-mail address: it re-keys their rows onto
 * the new one ({@link RekeyUserContent}).
 *
 * <p>The address is not an identifier here, it is a NAME that identity happens to use as one — the
 * author column holds whatever the token said at upload time. Until this listener existed, a
 * confirmed address change stranded a person's whole history: their memes stopped being theirs,
 * their votes stopped counting for them, and an account deletion marked nothing while confirming
 * an erasure, which left the images in the gallery for the next registrant of the freed address to
 * inherit.
 *
 * <p>{@code security-events} is the facts topic, so most of what arrives on it is somebody else's
 * business — {@code ACCOUNT_DELETION_REQUESTED} belongs to microservice-offboarding, which turns it
 * into the purge commands {@link PurgeCommandsListener} answers. Everything but
 * {@code EMAIL_CHANGED} is ignored WITHOUT a word: a fact this service has no use for is not an
 * anomaly, and a log line per deletion request in the portal would be noise that teaches an
 * operator to stop reading.
 *
 * <p>The wiring is deliberately the purge listener's, down to the group id: one consumer group per
 * service ({@code memes}), a container id spelled out so {@link SagaListenersHealth} can name it
 * under {@code /actuator/health}, {@code auto-offset-reset=earliest} from
 * {@code application.properties} (a group with no committed offset must read the renames that were
 * announced before it existed, not skip them), and the same error handler, retry budget and
 * heartbeat that {@link SagaParticipantConfig} installs on every container. None of that had to be
 * asked for; all of it would have been missing had this listener been wired anywhere else, and a
 * listener the health lamp does not know about is a listener nobody notices dying.
 *
 * <p>One transaction per record, because the re-key touches three tables and half a person is worse
 * than none of them. A failure propagates out of {@link #receive} and the record is retried with
 * backoff — which is safe precisely because the re-key is idempotent (see {@link RekeyUserContent}).
