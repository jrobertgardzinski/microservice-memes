/**
 * The lamp for this service's Kafka listener loop — the one signal a Spring saga participant was
 * missing while both Helidon participants had it ({@code PurgeCommandsConsumer.healthy()} in
 * microservice-user-collections, {@code KafkaLoop.healthy()} in microservice-offboarding).
 *
 * <p><strong>The failure it exists to reveal.</strong> Spring Kafka stops a listener container on
 * unrecoverable trouble (a {@code TopicAuthorizationException}, an {@code Error} on the consumer
 * thread) and a container can also wedge inside one record. Neither shows anywhere else: the JVM
 * keeps serving the gallery, {@code docker compose ps} stays green, {@code up == 1} in Prometheus,
 * and every account deletion in the portal quietly stops closing — the orchestrator waits 120s,
 * re-commands three times, capitulates, and each leaver gets an apology mail instead of an erasure.
 * A green suite, a green stack and a green dashboard all pass through that failure without a trace,
 * which is exactly the blind spot the 26.07 audit named.
 *
 * <p><strong>Readiness, deliberately, not liveness.</strong> A stopped listener is not a dead
 * process: HTTP works, and a restart cannot fix the broker or the database that stopped it. This is
 * the same split the two Helidons arrived at ({@code /alive} versus {@code /health}) — restarting on
 * liveness heals a wedged process, restarting on a broken dependency only crash-loops. So this
 * contributor belongs to the {@code readiness} group (wired in {@code application.properties}) and
 * never to {@code liveness}.
 *
 * <p><strong>What it does NOT do: it is not a broker probe.</strong> With the broker unreachable the
 * container keeps polling and keeps publishing idle events, so this lamp stays green. That is a
 * choice, not an oversight. A broker outage IS reported — by collections' and offboarding's own
 * health, whose loops probe it — and readiness in k8s gates HTTP traffic: red-lighting every memes
 * replica because Kafka blinked would take the whole gallery out of the Service for a fault that has
 * nothing to do with serving images. This lamp answers one question only: "is MY listener loop still
 * turning?"
 *
 * <p><strong>How the loop reports that it turned.</strong> From BOTH ends of the poll, because
 * either one alone lies about half the time:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an empty poll publishes a {@link ListenerContainerIdleEvent} once per
 *       {@code spring.kafka.listener.idle-event-interval}, and records starting again publish a
 *       {@link ListenerContainerNoLongerIdleEvent}. This is what keeps a silent topic — and
 *       {@code content-commands} is silent for days at a time — from reading as a dead one;</li>
 *   <li>every record handed to a listener stamps the marker too, via the interceptor
 *       {@code SagaParticipantConfig} installs on the containers ({@link #recordDelivered}).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The second half was missing until 2026-07-30 (it reached the comments twin a day earlier and
 * not this one), and its absence inverted the lamp exactly when the answer mattered. Idle events
 * fire only on EMPTY polls; the no-longer-idle event fires only on the idle→busy TRANSITION. A loop
 * consuming without pause therefore publishes nothing at all, so the marker stood still and the
 * lamp went DOWN after the tolerance — while the loop was working. The tolerance is 150s, derived
 * from the retry budget of ONE record; draining a backlog after a broker outage (the duplicate
 * storm this service's own manifests plan for with {@code strategy: Recreate}) exceeds it easily.
 * At {@code replicas: 1} readiness then takes the only pod out of the Service precisely while the
 * system is healing, and it teaches the operator that a red lamp means nothing. A lamp that is
 * wrong when the system is under stress is worse than no lamp.
