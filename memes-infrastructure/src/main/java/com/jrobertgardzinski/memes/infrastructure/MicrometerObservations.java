/**
 * The one class in this service that knows what a metric is called.
 *
 * <p>Everything above it states facts ({@link Observation}); here they are given this month's
 * spelling — {@code memes_erasure_backlog}, {@code memes_kafka_records_dropped_total} — the shape
 * Prometheus wants and the labels an alert matches on. Swapping Micrometer for whatever comes next
 * is rewriting this file and nothing else, which is the entire reason the port exists.
 *
 * <p>Two deliberate translations, and neither is obvious from the fact alone:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the backlog is a GAUGE. The question is "how many obligations right now", so it has to fall
 *       back to zero on its own the moment a closure finally lands — which is also why the use case
 *       states it on every pass, zero included.</li>
 *   <li>a dropped command is a COUNTER, labelled by topic. It never falls; one increment is one
 *       saga command this service will never carry out, and an operator wants the total since the
 *       process started, not a number that quietly forgets.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A backlog that could NOT be read states nothing at all, and that is the honest behaviour
 * rather than a gap: the gauge keeps its last value, where reporting zero would turn a failed
 * database read into "the backlog is clear".
