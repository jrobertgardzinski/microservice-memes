/**
 * How the account-closure commands REACH this service: a Kafka record, a correlation id in a
 * header, JSON on the wire. What the service then does about them is
 * {@link MemesClosureParticipant}, over in memes_account-closure, which knows none of that —
 * this class exists to make sure it never has to.
 *
 * <p>So the split is: everything here is about the carrier (which topic, which group, which
 * header, what a malformed body means), and everything there is about the closure (which use
 * case a command means, which rule applies, what is confirmed and what is not). A monolith
 * assembly replaces this file and keeps that one.
 *
 * <p>The three guarantees around the carrier stay here too, because they are the carrier's:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a command is no longer lost to a one-second hiccup — {@link SagaRetryBudget} retries it
 *       with backoff for a budget derived from the orchestrator's own timeline, then drops it
 *       loudly and counted instead of silently in a millisecond;</li>
 *   <li>a stalled listener loop no longer hides behind a green process —
 *       {@link SagaListenersHealth} turns readiness red;</li>
 *   <li>the confirmation is no longer a bare fire-and-forget send — {@link PurgeConfirmations}
 *       writes it into the outbox, in the SAME transaction as the step it confirms. That
 *       transaction is this class's contribution to the participant: it hands it a
 *       {@code TransactionTemplate} wearing the participant's own name for "all of it or none of
 *       it", and the use case's transactional decorator joins it (Spring's default propagation),
 *       exactly as {@code MemesEventsListener} does for the cascade in microservice-comments.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Enabled only where a broker exists (compose sets KAFKA_ENABLED) — tests exercise the use
 * cases directly and the whole loop runs in the workspace smoke test.
