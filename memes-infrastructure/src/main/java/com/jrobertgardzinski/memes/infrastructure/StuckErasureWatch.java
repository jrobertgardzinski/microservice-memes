/**
 * The clock behind {@link WatchErasureBacklog}, and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>What it used to be: the query, the threshold, the decision and the gauge in one class in
 * infrastructure. What is left here is what genuinely belongs to a framework — a schedule, and the
 * handling of a database failure in the vocabulary of the database library.
 *
 * <p>The schedule hangs off {@code @EnableScheduling}, which this service switches on together with
 * the broker (the outbox config). That is the right coupling rather than an accident: without a
 * broker there is no saga, so there are no marks and nothing to watch.
