/**
 * What makes this service a well-behaved PARTICIPANT of the account-deletion saga, in one place: the
 * error policy of the listener that consumes purge commands, the health lamp for the loop that runs
 * it, and the outbox-backed confirmation it sends back.
 *
 * <p>The 26.07 audit's second theme was that the participant role is implemented four times with four
 * different sets of guarantees. Round 10 unified the OUTBOX (a kernel library, one implementation);
 * this class unifies the CONSUMING side of the two Spring participants with what the two Helidon ones
 * already had: a bounded retry with backoff instead of ten immediate attempts and a silent commit, and
 * a readiness signal for a loop that has stopped turning.
 *
 * <p>The error policy and the confirmation channel hang off {@code memes.kafka-enabled}, like the
 * listener and the outbox they serve — without a broker there is neither a record to retry nor an
 * outbox to write to. The health lamp does NOT, and that asymmetry is forced rather than chosen:
 * Spring Boot validates health-group membership at startup, so a {@code readiness} group naming a
 * contributor that only exists with a broker would refuse to boot every broker-less run, the whole
 * test suite included. The lamp is therefore always registered and knows which of the two situations
 * it is reporting on (see {@link SagaListenersHealth}).
