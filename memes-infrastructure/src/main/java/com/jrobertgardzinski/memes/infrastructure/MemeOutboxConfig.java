 * there is nothing to be durable towards: {@link NoopMemeEvents} takes the port, no outbox row is
 * ever written, and — the part that matters — no scheduler thread wakes up every 15 seconds in a
 * test JVM to poll a table. That is also why {@code @EnableScheduling} sits HERE and not in the
 * library: switching on a whole framework subsystem in someone else's application is not a
 * library's business, and this configuration is the one place that knows scheduling is wanted.
