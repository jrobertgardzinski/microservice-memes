/**
 * Postgres-backed {@link MemeRepository} (H2 in dev/tests): metadata in the meme row, the image
 * bytes delegated to the {@link ObjectStore} — written and read together, so a meme and its
 * object never drift. The publication time recorded on save is what the hot ranking decays by;
 * the ranking reads it joined onto the vote aggregate, not one meme at a time.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every SELECT below names {@code active_memes}, never {@code memes}</strong> — the view
 * V10 created, whose whole body is {@code WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'}. That is the single place the
 * account-deletion filter is written down in this service: a meme a running saga has marked is
 * absent from the gallery, from {@code /meta}, from the existence checks that gate votes and
 * thumbnails, and from the ids the ranking may speak about, without any of those queries knowing
 * that erasure exists. Writes still name the table, because a view is not what you insert a meme
 * into — and {@code MemeReadFilterTest} enforces exactly that split, so the next SELECT written
 * here cannot quietly become the leak.
