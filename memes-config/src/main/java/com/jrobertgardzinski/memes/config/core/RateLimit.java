/**
 * A fixed per-key, per-minute window — server policy against abuse. Keyed by the caller (here the
 * uploader's e-mail), so one account cannot flood the gallery while everyone else uploads freely.
 * Uploads are heavier than comments (decode + optimise), which is exactly why they get a ceiling.
 * Zero disables the guard. Pure logic; no framework.
 *
 * <p>A NEGATIVE ceiling is refused at construction. It would also disable the guard — {@code
 * tryAcquire} short-circuits on {@code perMinute <= 0} — so a mistyped property would silently
 * turn the abuse guard OFF and the gallery would look healthy while one account flooded it.
 * Zero says that out loud; {@code -1} only looks like a number. Same reading as {@code TagLimits},
 * which refuses a negative ceiling for the mirror-image reason.
