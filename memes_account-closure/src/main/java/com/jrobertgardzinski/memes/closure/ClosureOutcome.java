 * to go. The portal's one-process specs read it, and nothing else does.
 *
 * <p>The collections participant works the other way round — it returns its outcome and its
 * consumer builds the confirmation — and which of the two shapes all three should take is a
 * decision about assembly, not about closing an account. It is open on purpose. Until it is
 * settled, this type states the answer and lets the caller ignore it.
